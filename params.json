It has two main goals:\r\n\r\n- Make it easier to work with list objects used to store data in more flexible structures than data frames.\r\n\r\n- Quickly perform a wide range of functions and manipulations on non-relational data structured as list objects.\r\n\r\n*Currently, this package is still on a very early stage. Its functions and implmentations may change overtime and cannot guarantee the backward compatibility. Please be cautious when you use it in production.*\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install the latest development version from GitHub with\r\n\r\n```\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"rlist\",\"renkun-ken\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nA simple list will be generated to demonstrate the functions.\r\n\r\nSuppose we have a list of developers, each of which has a name, age, some interests and a list of programming langauge they use and the number of years they have been using them.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndevelopers <- \r\n  list(\r\n    p1=list(name=\"Ken\",age=24,\r\n      interest=c(\"reading\",\"music\",\"movies\"),\r\n      lang=list(r=2,csharp=4,python=3)),\r\n    p2=list(name=\"James\",age=25,\r\n      interest=c(\"sports\",\"music\"),\r\n      lang=list(r=3,java=2,cpp=5)),\r\n    p3=list(name=\"Penny\",age=24,\r\n      interest=c(\"movies\",\"reading\"),\r\n      lang=list(r=1,cpp=4,python=2)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Subsetting\r\n\r\nIf we want to know the names of those whose age is below 25, we can write\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(rlist)\r\nsubset(developers,age < 25, name)\r\n```\r\nThe output is\r\n```\r\n$p1\r\n[1] \"Ken\"\r\n\r\n$p3\r\n[1] \"Penny\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want to know the names and ages of those who like music and uses C++, we can write\r\n\r\n```\r\nsubset(developers,\"music\" %in% interest & \"cpp\" %in% names(lang),list(name=name,age=age))\r\n```\r\nThe output is \r\n```\r\n$p2\r\n$p2$name\r\n[1] \"James\"\r\n\r\n$p2$age\r\n[1] 25\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want to know, instead, how long they have been using R for those who use Python, we can write\r\n\r\n```\r\nsubset(developers, \"python\" %in% names(lang), lang$r)\r\n```\r\nThe output is\r\n```\r\n$p1\r\n[1] 2\r\n\r\n$p3\r\n[1] 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe principle is simple: evaluate the select expression for each list item that satifies the subset expression.\r\n\r\n## Help overview\r\n\r\n```\r\nhelp(package = rlist)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis package is under [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n","google":"UA-47159422-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
